:::info
The aim of React Native Elements is to provide an all-in-one UI kit for creating apps in react native. There are many great ui components made by developers all around open source. React Native Elements takes the hassle of assembling these packages together by giving you a ready made kit with consistent api and look and feel.

## Installation

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0 }}>
  <div class="row is-multiline">
    <div class="col col--4">
      <Link
        class="card"
        to="installation#using-expo"
        style={{ height: '100%' }}
      >
        <div class="card__body">
          <h4>Expo</h4>
          <p>Guide to install with expo-cli</p>
        </div>
      </Link>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--4">
      <Link class="card" to="installation" style={{ height: '100%' }}>
        <div class="card__body">
          <h4>React Native CLI</h4>
          <p>Guide to install with react-native cli</p>
        </div>
      </Link>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--4">
      <Link
        class="card"
        to="installation#using-on-web"
        style={{ height: '100%' }}
      >
        <div class="card__body">
          <h4>React app</h4>
          <p>Guide to install with create-react-app</p>
        </div>
      </Link>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Quick start

Here's a quick example to get you started, **it's literally all you need:**

```ts
import { Button } from '@react-native-elements/base';

const App = () => {
  return <Button title="Hello World" />;
};
```

## Using themed components

The components in this library have a single theme running through them. From
one central location, we can update the colours used in all components. While
this was great for the developers of the library, the actual users also needed a
way to use this feature.

But why stop at colours? Why not allow the props of every component to be
defined in one central place? And so the idea behind theming with React Native
Elements was born!

```jsx
import { Button, ThemeProvider } from '@react-native-elements/themed';

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button title="Hey!" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

To customize the theme, or use it within your own components, be sure to check
the docs on [Customization](customization).
