When pressed, a floating action button can display three to six related actions in the form of a speed dial. If more than six actions are needed, something other than a FAB should be used to present them. Upon press, the FAB remains visible and emits a stack of related actions. If the FAB is tapped in this state, it should either initiate its default action or close the speed dial actions.
